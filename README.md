# emma-auth
PHP Authentication for Emmanuel College, for use with Mabel. Uses Raven and Ibis.

To use, two files need to be added.

## Ibis Keys (maybe)
I don't remember where I found these or if they're required for this but I have them and it works - so maybe find them somewhere...

## Mabel key
This is definitely required - a file called "mabel.txt" in the root. This should contain just the appropriate external key from mabel's config.json
